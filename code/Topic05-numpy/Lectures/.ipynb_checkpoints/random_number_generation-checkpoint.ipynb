It is a very widely used and reliable method for generating random numbers. However, starting with version 1.17, the `numpy.random` module offers random number generators with better speed and statistical performance, including the [PCG64 generator](http://www.pcg-random.org). Going forward, the preferred approach to doing random number generation is to first instantiate a generator of your choice, and then use its methods to generate numbers out of probability distributions.\n",
